# Music Land
## Why I creat this project
* When I sitting in front of my computer, listening music, and expecting the holiday, I feel light and cheerful, so I wonder,why don't I just express this kind of feeling?
* so I want to build a scene: the land is leaping follow the music, and the sun is shining the land
## Basic indroduce of project
* this is a music visualization project made by OPENFRAMEWORKS.
* I use perlin noise to creat mesh,and circle,then I use sound to control the noise and circle, let them leap with the music.just like we are on the way to go to travel on a nice day!
* accually it still have some little prolem need to be develop,like color.
